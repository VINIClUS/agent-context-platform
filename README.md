# Agent Context Platform

`agent-context-platform` is the service boundary for the authoritative event ledger, verified
content storage, rebuildable projections, retrieval, indexing, and the read-only MCP endpoint.

The repository owns FastAPI and remote platform behavior. Canonical event and query contracts live
in `agent-context-sdk`; Codex-local capture and redaction live in `agent-context-codex`; deployment
inventory and secrets references live in `agent-context-infra`. Do not duplicate their contracts
here.

See the [approved architecture](docs/2026-08-13-agent-context-platform-design.md), the
[platform implementation plan](docs/2026-08-13-agent-context-platform.md), and the
[cross-repository roadmap](docs/2026-08-13-agent-context-master-roadmap.md).

## Requirements

- Python 3.12, 3.13, or 3.14
- uv 0.11.28

## Set up and run

Install the exact locked dependencies:

```bash
uv sync --frozen
```

Run the application factory locally:

```bash
uv run --frozen uvicorn agent_context_platform.app:create_app \
  --factory --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

The process-only liveness endpoint is `GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/health/live`. It does not
represent readiness of PostgreSQL, object storage, Neo4j, or any other external service.

## Quality gates

Run the same gates as CI:

```bash
uv lock --check
uv sync --frozen
uv run --frozen ruff check .
uv run --frozen ruff format --check .
uv run --frozen mypy src
uv run --frozen pytest -q
```

Pytest registers the `unit`, `integration`, `contract`, and `e2e` markers. The suite enforces 90%
branch coverage.

## Development workflow

Create feature worktrees as siblings of repository checkouts, using an immutable SHA captured from
the required base. Branches follow `agent/<lowercase-task-id>-<slug>`, such as
`agent/platform-001-fastapi-quality-scaffold`.

Keep each task within its declared repository and paths. Use Conventional Commits, run the targeted
test during development, and run every quality gate before requesting integration.
